# Sound Files for HubMath

This directory should contain sound effects for the math game. The application is looking for the following files:

- `correct.mp3`: Sound played when the user answers correctly
- `wrong.mp3`: Sound played when the user answers incorrectly
- `countdown.mp3`: Sound played during the countdown
- `start.mp3`: Sound played when the game starts
- `complete.mp3`: Sound played when the game is completed

## How to Add Sound Files

1. Download or create MP3 sound files with the exact names listed above
2. Place them in this directory (`public/sounds/`)
3. The application will automatically use these sound files when they are available

- [Freesound](https://freesound.org/)

## Note

The application has been updated to handle missing sound files gracefully, so it will continue to function even if these files are not present. However, adding the sound files will enhance the user experience.
